    <p>Ethan Blackwood grew up in a small, coastal town, where he spent most of his childhood tinkering with electronics and teaching himself to code. As a shy and introverted teenager, Ethan found solace in music, spending hours in his makeshift home studio, experimenting with beats and melodies. After completing high school, Ethan enrolled in a local college, studying computer science and music production. However, it wasn't until he stumbled upon an underground electronic music scene that he discovered his true calling – and the persona of Freighter Bite was born.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center">Who I am?</h2>
    <img class="img-fluid my-3 rounded-4" src="images/lego.jpg " alt="banner">
    <p>"Growing up, I was always fascinated by the power of music and storytelling. As a kid, I would spend hours watching music videos and concerts, mesmerized by the performers' energy and charisma. But it wasn't until I discovered my own passion for singing and songwriting that I knew I wanted to pursue a career in music. I started writing my own songs and performing at local venues, and soon discovered that music was not only a way for me to express myself, but also a way to connect with others. As I continued to hone my craft, I began to explore other creative outlets, including YouTube and social media. I discovered that I loved creating content and sharing my ideas with others, and soon built a community of like-minded individuals who shared my passions.
        Today, as Freight Bite, I'm proud to be a singer, YouTuber, influencer, and vlogger, using my platforms to inspire and entertain others. I'm grateful for the opportunity to share my story and connect with all of you."</p>
